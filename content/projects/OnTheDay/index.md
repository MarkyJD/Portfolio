As part of my degree, I undertook a real-world industy-based project focused on building a software solution for a Melbourne based charter company. The solution is a map-based fleet management system, fully featured with live GPS Tracking, fleet reporting, and a historical data view. It includes System Maintenance guides and User Manuals as well as Documentation.

We were given 24 weeks in total - 12 weeks to anaylse their current solution and come up with a solution and prototype to integrate into their tech stack. And then a further 12 weeks to actually develop and implement the app.

- Full-Stack Web app using PERN stack
- Worked as a team of four using agile methodologies through Jira
  - Story mapping
  - Sprints and Scrums
  - Backlog tracking
- Worked closely with the Client with regular presentations and Q&A sessions
- Worked within a strict time-frame with set deliverables and milestones
